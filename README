NAME
    Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::RequireSheBang - simple policy for
    keeping your shebang line uniform

AFFILIATION
    This policy is a policy in the Perl::Critic::logicLAB distribution. The
    policy is themed: logiclab.

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.02.

DESCRIPTION
    This policy is intended in guarding your use of the shebang line. It
    assists in making sure that your shebang line adheres to certain
    formats.

    The default format is

        #!/usr/local/bin/perl
    
    You can however specify another or define your own in the configuration
    of the policy.

    NB this policy does currently not warn about missing shebang lines, it
    only checks shebang lines encountered.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    This policy allow you to configure the contents of the shebang lines you
    want to allow using formats.

  formats
        [logicLAB::RequireSheBang]
        formats = #!/usr/local/bin/perl || #!/usr/bin/perl || #!perl || #!env perl

    Since the default shebang line enforced by the policy is:

        #!/usr/local/bin/perl
    
    Please note that if you however what to extend the pattern, you also
    have to specify was is normally the default pattern since configuration
    overwrites the default even for extensions.

    This mean that if you want to allow:

        #!/usr/local/bin/perl

        #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
    
        #!/usr/local/bin/perl -wT
        
    Your format should look like the following:

        [logicLAB::RequireSheBang]
        formats = #!/usr/local/bin/perl || #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w || #!/usr/local/bin/perl -wT
